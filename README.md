2019 FALL CUNY GC  Data Visualization Final Project.

This tool allows users to interact locally with citi bike visulizations with all freedom, including selecting any hour of the day, selecting any start or stop stations. Users even are able to see the entire dataset with all kinds of actions, including filtering and sorting.


Instructions: 
1. Download interaction.py, install necessary library in the head of the file by typing the following command 
   pip install dash, dash_table,plotly
   
2. Compile locally.

3. Copy the local address in the command window and open a browser to access it.

4. User has three main interactive units: 
   1) interactive table showing all source data,
   2) two dropdowns that allow user to select start and stop station correspondingly,
   3) one slider at the bottom of the page that user can select the start hour of any trip
   
   For 1), user can type any relevant value in the "filter data" box by adding " + value + ", since the 
   data is stored as string, so user has to add quotation marks to make the value into a string.
